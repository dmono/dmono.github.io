Aside from coding, I have worn many hats over the course of my career in tech. With 10 years of experience in product management, project management, UX, and web design, I know how to build products from start to finish.

When not in front of a computer, I enjoy hands-on creative pursuits. The current phase is calligraphy and clothing construction. 

I'm always open to interesting projects and opportunities, so feel free to <a href="mailto:terryleedev@gmail.com">contact me</a>!
